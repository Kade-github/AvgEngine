# Introduction

Hello, welcome to AvgEngine. Probably the last thing you should use for a finished product *cough cough.* But a good learning experince at least.

This is an engine built in **CPP**, which is super scary!!! oooo. But seriously, this is my first real big project in CPP and it's a pretty simple batching engine.

**ALSO:** This engine isn't even fully done yet! There are things missing, and things will be added later. Currently, this is just for me to show to people going "look at this!!!"

# Building

This was made in mind with Visual Studio, so we are using **MSBuild**.

# Example

The basic example for how to use this is inside of the project. So when you clone it, just look in that filter in Visual Studio.
